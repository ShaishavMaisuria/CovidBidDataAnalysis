# CovidBigDataAnalysis

**Topic:** Covid-19 Data Lake analysis

**Team Members:** Anuj Sharma, Aayush Patel, Shaishav Maisuria, Ishani Naik, Kautilya Kondragunta

**Communication Plan:**
Members of the team will most likely communicate using online platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet. Each team member will most likely be allocated tasks that contribute to the project based on their strengths and weaknesses. Any team members experiencing trouble will most likely arrange up "doubt scrum meetings" with other team members who have domain knowledge on that topic. In addition, each Team member will most likely participate in a weekly scrum during which all project components will be tested, explained, and improved before submission. Based on the task requirements for that week, team members will likely gather on Friday for a "doubtScrum meeting" and Sunday for a "Weekly scrum meeting" from 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm. The goal for each week is to submit the assignment one day before the deadline, which is Monday. 

**Introduction to Problem:**
AWS Covid-19 data lake is open source. In our project, we will be using this dataset for analysis using AWS. Building models could do the research for forecasting Covid-19 hotspots, arranging beds and ventilators based on the new cases and trends, and checking vaccine availability in various cities. We want to predict several other movements related to the pandemic.

**Research Questions:**

* How many people were tested, pending tests, and positive and negative tests for COVID-19?

* What percentage of the population took the vaccine?

* What is the trend of the virus (are the daily cases rising or are they decreasing)?

* What percentage of the population is hospitalized?
