Covid-19 Data Lake analysis

Team Members: Anuj Sharma, Aayush Patel, Shaishav Maisuria

Introduction to Problem:
AWS Covid-19 data lake is open source. In our project we will be using this dataset for analysis using AWS. Analysis could be made such as -
Building models for forecasting Covid-19 hotspot
Arranging beds and ventilator based on the new cases and trends
Checking vaccine availabilty in varius cities 
We want to predict several other trends related to the pandemic. 

Research Questions:
- How many people were tested, pending tests, and positive and negative tests for COVID-19?

- What percentage of the population took the vaccine?

- What is the trend of the virus (are the daily cases rising or are they decreasing) ?

- What percentage of the population is hospitalized?
